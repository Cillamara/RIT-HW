Problem1.java

/* The problem is that the Problem class has the public access modifier 
* however the filename is not Problem.java and there is no package assigned 
* to the file. This results in a syntax error. To easily fix this you can 
* either remove the public access modifier, change the class name from 
* Problem to Problem1, change the file name from Problem1.java to 
* Problem.java.
*/


Problem2.java

/*
* The problem is that i is declared as an integer however it is initialized 
* as in.next(). According to the java api on Scanner, the next() method had a 
* modifier and type of string which is incompatable with int. To fix this we can 
* replace .next() with .nextint() which is compatible with integers.

*/


Problem3.java

// 5 divided by 0 is undefined and therefore this results in a runtime error.


Problem4.java

/* 
* The problem with the syntax as y is not declared as an integer. As it is 
* a syntax error it would result in a compile error.
*/


Problem5.java
/*
* There is no return statement for when x is greater than or equal to y. 
* Because it is not void there must be a return statement for every scenario. 
* Therefore this will result in a compile error
*/


Problem6.java
/*
* There are no values in the array list yet so getting a value at index 0 
* will return a null causing a run time error.
*/


Problem7.java

/*
*To use char u can only use single quotes. This is a compile error and to fix 
* this you can replace "a" with 'a'.
*/


Problem8.java
/*
* The k variable is assigned to the j variable but the j variable is not 
* initialized. Attempting to use a local variable with no value assigned
* will result in an error when the program compiles.
*/


Problem9.java
/*
* By default java assumes a number with a decimal is a double if not specified. 
* There is a syntax error because sum is declared a float but 0.0 is a double. 
* To fix this you can change 0.0 to 0.0f.
*/


Problem10.java
/*
* There are only 11 characters in "Hello World however the index ends at 12 
* instead of 10. This returns a null values which causes a runtime error.
