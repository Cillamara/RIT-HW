Problem1
    Compiler error: Class Problem is undefined.
                    Should replace class declaration with "Problem1"

Problem 2
    Compiler error: Scanner method next() returns a string,
                    but variable "i" is defined as an integer.

Problem 3
    Runtime error: Program will compile, but will give
                   an error when dividing by zero

Problem 4
    Compiler error: Arguments of min aren't properly defined.
                    Need to add "int" before argument "y"

Problem 5
    Compiler error: There is no return statement outside the conditional.
                    If x > y, the program has no return statement

Problem 6
    Runtime error: Variable "list" is uninitialized, thus has values of null.
                   The get(0) method is out of bounds since
                   there is nothing at index 0

Problem 7
    Compiler error: Primitive type "char" requires declarations to be
                    surrounded by single quotes, not double quotes

Problem 8
    Compiler error: Variable "j" is uninitialized.

Problem 9
    Compiler error: Variable "sum" requires a float type.
                    This requires "f" to be added to the end of the number,
                    otherwise it will be a double

Problem 10
    Runtime error: The substring method is out of bounds.
                   That is, there is no value in the string at index 11.
                   Range should read (6,11)
